# betaflight-tx-lua-scripts
Collection of scripts to configure Betaflight from your TX (currently only supported in OpenTx)

PLEASE NOTE WELL: there is currently an issue in OpenTX (opentx/opentx#4560) which prevents many LUA scripts to work correctly with OpenTX 2.2.0-RC11. So stay away from RC11.
