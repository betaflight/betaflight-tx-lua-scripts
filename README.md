# Taranis VTx Lua Script

This stripped-down fork of [betaflight-tx-lua-scripts](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-tx-lua-scripts) includes only VTx configuration for Taranis transmitters only.  Taranis VTx was created to save memory on your transmitter so other Lua scripts (for example [Lua Telemetry](https://github.com/iNavFlight/LuaTelemetry)) can run on the same model. This script should work with [Betaflight](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight) as well as [INAV](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav).
